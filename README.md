## Project Description

This is an application that takes the game of Minesweeper and implements constraint propigation to make a solver for the game. This project was written in JS React and JS Redux primarily as an npm project. I started on this project midway, so not all of this is my code. I was responisble for restructuring and rewritting the UI elements and some of the constraint propigation logic. Most of my work can be found in the src/components file. The components are written in both JS React and Redux and define how the webiste looks online. 
## My Contribution
My task for this project was to update and revamp the UI of this game. Here is a comparison of what the website looked like before and how it looks now.

As you can tell from this, the UI was not pretty and hard to follow. It was also confusing on how to select/deselect the different solving algorithms and was not visually appealing. Here is the site after I made my edits.

As you can see, everything is more conscise and better spaced. The interface is easier to naviagate and use and is visually more appealing.
