# Minesweeper

This is an application that takes the game of Minesweeper and implements constraint propigation to make a solver for the game. This project was written in JS React and JS Redux primarily as an npm project. I started on this project midway, so not all of this is my code. I was responisble for restructuring and rewritting the UI elements and some of the constraint propigation logic. Most of my work can be found in the src/components file. The components are written in both JS React and Redux and define how the webiste looks online. Here is a comparison of what the website looked like before and how it looks now.
